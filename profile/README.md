## Hi there 👋

This is Pig from LineageOS

 - 🙋‍♀️ This Org is mainly for storing source codes for ovaltine (OnePlus 10T / ACE Pro) that have not made it to the upstream Lineage gerrit yet
 - 🪲 Currently, the main bugs are: Inaccurate auto-brightness, and occasional system lockups.
 - 👩‍💻 Documentation on how to build by yourself will be updated soon.
 - 🍿 Find my Telegram group chat below!
   
- Obviously, I am maintaining LineageOS for ![OnePlus 10T](https://img.shields.io/badge/OnePlus%2010T/ACEPro-fd4900?style=flat-square&logo=OnePlus&logoColor=ffffff)  aka ovaltine.
